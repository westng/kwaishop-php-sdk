> 🚀 **Kuaishou E-commerce PHP SDK** - A complete Kuaishou E-commerce API integration solution for PHP developers

## Overview

In an era of rapid technological growth, the KwaiShopSDK of the Kuaishou E-commerce Open Platform should have been a practical tool available to all developers. It covers Kuaishou E-commerce related open capabilities. From token acquisition to request packaging and response parsing, every step should help developers integrate efficiently.

Its localized design should have created a smoother path for developers of all experience levels, allowing them to move through API integration with far less friction. Yet the reality is surprising: in the highly active and mature PHP ecosystem, there is still no official PHP SDK.

That gap is hard to justify. PHP developers have contributed enormously to the internet, yet when developers in other languages can move faster with official SDK support, PHP teams are still left to push through the thorns by hand. It is the equivalent of running a marathon barefoot while everyone else has proper gear and full support.

Community-driven SDK work is what keeps PHP developers from falling behind, making it possible to build serious integration systems despite the extra effort required. A proper PHP SDK should not be an afterthought, and this project exists to provide the missing foundation.

## Features

- Supports PHP `8.1+`
- Supports `FPM`
- Supports `Swoole Coroutine`
- Built-in `Guzzle` transport implementation
- Supports `MD5` and `HMAC_SHA256` signing
- Unified `Config` object
- OAuth support for authorize URL building, code exchange, token refresh, and `client_credentials`
- Shared request factory and response parser
- API implementations organized by documentation category under `src/Api/*`
- Standard request primitives: `get()`, `post()`, `postJson()`, `upload()`
- Low-level `rawRequest()` fallback for gateway calls
- PHPUnit test foundation and manual debug scripts

## Usage Requirements

### Developer Requirements

- Before using the SDK, you must first register as a Kuaishou E-commerce developer. Please refer to the [developer quick start documentation](https://open.kwaixiaodian.com/zone/new/docs/dev).
- Before using the SDK, you must already have access to the target APIs. All SDK usage is tied to the permission groups granted to your application.

Notes:

- `Api/*` is organized by official documentation category, making endpoint lookup easier
- `Client/*` contains the SDK entry point, request abstractions, and request pipeline
- `Generated/*` contains auto-generated client method mappings
- `KwaiShopClient` now lives at `KwaiShopSDK\Client\KwaiShopClient`
- If you want to check whether an endpoint is already wrapped, look in the matching category directory first

## Installation

```bash
composer require westng/kwaishop-php-sdk
```

## Quick Start

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use KwaiShopSDK\Exception\KwaiShopException;
use KwaiShopSDK\Client\KwaiShopClient;

$client = new KwaiShopClient(
    'your-app-key',
    'your-app-secret',
    'your-sign-secret',
    [
        'accessToken' => 'your-access-token',
    ]
);

try {
    $response = $client
        ->OpenShopInfoGet()
        ->setParams([])
        ->send();

    print_r($response);
} catch (KwaiShopException $e) {
    echo "Error: {$e->getMessage()}";
}
```

`KwaiShopClient` is created through the unified entrypoint `new KwaiShopClient($appKey, $appSecret, $signSecret, $options)`.

- The fourth argument is an associative `options` array
- Common options include `accessToken`, `baseUrl`, `connectTimeout`, `readTimeout`, `autoDetectRuntime`, `signMethod`, and `userAgent`

Version `1.0.0` already includes the reusable SDK foundation and endpoint wrappers organized by official documentation category.

## Hyperf Integration (Recommended)

If your project runs on `Hyperf / Swoole Coroutine`, the recommended approach is to register `KwaiShopClient` once in the container so credential and runtime configuration stay centralized instead of being rebuilt in application code.

Start with a dedicated config file such as `config/autoload/kwaishop.php`:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use function Hyperf\Support\env;

return [
    'app_key' => env('KWAISHOP_APP_KEY', ''),
    'app_secret' => env('KWAISHOP_APP_SECRET', ''),
    'sign_secret' => env('KWAISHOP_SIGN_SECRET', ''),
    'access_token' => env('KWAISHOP_ACCESS_TOKEN', ''),
    'options' => [
        'connectTimeout' => 5.0,
        'readTimeout' => 10.0,
        'autoDetectRuntime' => true,
    ],
];
```

Then register the client in `config/autoload/dependencies.php`:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Hyperf\Contract\ConfigInterface;
use KwaiShopSDK\Client\KwaiShopClient;
use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;

return [
    KwaiShopClient::class => static function (ContainerInterface $container): KwaiShopClient {
        $config = $container->get(ConfigInterface::class)->get('kwaishop', []);
        $options = is_array($config['options'] ?? null) ? $config['options'] : [];

        if (($config['access_token'] ?? '') !== '') {
            $options['accessToken'] = $config['access_token'];
        }

        return new KwaiShopClient(
            (string) ($config['app_key'] ?? ''),
            ($config['app_secret'] ?? null) !== null ? (string) $config['app_secret'] : null,
            (string) ($config['sign_secret'] ?? ''),
            $options
        );
    },
];
```

Your application service can then rely on constructor injection directly:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Service;

use KwaiShopSDK\Client\KwaiShopClient;

final class ShopService
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly KwaiShopClient $client,
    ) {
    }

    public function getShopInfo(): array
    {
        return $this->client
            ->OpenShopInfoGet()
            ->setParams([])
            ->send();
    }
}
```

If your Hyperf project already manages coroutine hooks, pooling, or runtime policy on its own, set `options.autoDetectRuntime` to `false` so the SDK does not try to auto-detect the runtime again.

## Runtime Compatibility

This SDK is designed with both `FPM` and `Swoole Coroutine` runtimes in mind.

- Core SDK objects remain stateless and do not store request context in static variables or global singletons
- `KwaiShopClient`, `Config`, the request factory, and the response parser are safe to reuse across concurrent requests
- The default transport uses `Guzzle`
- The SDK auto-detects the current runtime; when it detects `Swoole Coroutine` and hooks are not enabled yet, the default transport will try to enable coroutine hooks automatically
- The SDK auto-detects `FPM / CLI / Swoole` and adjusts connection reuse strategy automatically:
- `FPM / CLI` keep connection reuse enabled by default
- `Swoole / Swoole Coroutine` disable cross-request connection reuse by default to avoid stale reused connections in long-lived workers
- If your project already has a coroutine-native HTTP client, you can inject a custom `TransportInterface` implementation directly

### Swoole Coroutine Example

```php
use KwaiShopSDK\Client\KwaiShopClient;
use Swoole\Runtime;

Runtime::enableCoroutine(true);

$client = new KwaiShopClient(
    'your-app-key',
    'your-app-secret',
    'your-sign-secret',
);
```

If you explicitly do not want the SDK to adapt the runtime automatically, you can disable it:

```php
use KwaiShopSDK\Client\KwaiShopClient;

$client = new KwaiShopClient(
    'your-app-key',
    'your-app-secret',
    'your-sign-secret',
    [
        'autoDetectRuntime' => false,
    ]
);
```

## Authentication

Typical platform credentials include:

- `app_key`
- `app_secret`
- `sign_secret`

- Merchant-authorized endpoints usually also require an `accessToken`
- The recommended approach is to configure a default `accessToken` when initializing `Config`
- In multi-merchant scenarios, you can override the token per request with `setAccessToken()`

The SDK currently provides these OAuth capabilities:

- Build authorize URLs with `buildAuthorizeUrl()`
- Exchange `code` for token with `getAccessToken()`
- Refresh tokens with `refreshAccessToken()`
- Get application tokens with `getClientCredentialsToken()`

These methods are called through the OAuth helper returned by `$client->oauth()`, for example:

```php
$oauth = $client->oauth();

$authorizeUrl = $oauth->buildAuthorizeUrl(
    'https://your-callback.test/oauth/callback',
    ['merchant_order', 'merchant_item'],
    'your-state'
);
```

If you need local OAuth verification or functional debugging, you can still combine these capabilities with the repository test scripts separately.

## FAQ

### 1. There is no official PHP SDK. Can this be used in production?

Yes. This project exists to fill the PHP SDK gap for the Kuaishou E-commerce Open Platform, and already provides signing, authentication, request packaging, response parsing, and endpoint wrappers organized by official documentation categories.

### 2. Will the SDK apply for API permissions automatically?

No. The SDK only wraps the API calls. Whether a request can succeed depends on whether your application has the required permission groups and whether the merchant has completed authorization.

### 3. Do all endpoints require an `accessToken`?

No. Merchant-authorized endpoints require an `accessToken`, while endpoints without merchant authorization should be called according to the official platform documentation. The recommended approach is to configure a default `accessToken` in `Config`.

### 4. Does the SDK read `.env` automatically?

No. `.env.example` and `.env` are only used for tests and local debugging scripts. The SDK runtime does not load environment variable files automatically.

### 5. How can I check whether an endpoint has already been wrapped?

Start by checking the matching category under `src/Api/*`. Class names usually stay aligned with the official endpoint name, for example `open.shop.info.get` maps to `OpenShopInfoGet`.

## Contribution Guide

- Issues are welcome for bug reports, missing endpoint requests, and documentation improvements
The repository includes Chinese issue forms and automated issue comments with the following behavior:

- New issues receive a welcome and triage message automatically
- Bug-like issues with incomplete details receive a reminder to add SDK version, PHP version, reproduction steps, and error output
- Applying configured labels triggers an automatic reply
- Long-inactive issues receive follow-up comments automatically
- Closed issues receive a thank-you comment automatically
- The bot does not close issues automatically
- Before opening a PR, keep the change scope clear and avoid mixing unrelated edits
- When adding a new endpoint, place it under the matching official documentation category in `src/Api/*`
- Keep naming, directory structure, and SDK style consistent with the existing project
- If your change affects behavior, update the related tests and README documentation together
- Before submitting, run at least the tests related to your change to avoid shipping obviously broken updates
- Check code style before submitting, and run `composer cs-check` or `composer cs-fix` when needed

### Commit Convention

- Use a conventional commit prefix in the commit message: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, or `chore`
- The title should preferably follow the `type: subject` format, for example `feat: add open shop info api`
- Keep each commit focused on one clear responsibility instead of mixing endpoint additions, refactors, and documentation changes together
- Commit messages should describe the actual outcome of the change and should avoid vague descriptions such as `update` or `modify`
- Do not commit `.env`, local cache files, IDE settings, or other temporary files unrelated to the SDK itself

### Pull Request Convention

- The Pull Request title should clearly describe the change and should stay aligned with the main commit whenever possible
- The Pull Request description should explain the purpose, key changes, affected scope, and whether there is any compatibility impact
- If the Pull Request includes new endpoints, behavior changes, or documentation updates, update the related tests or README content together
- The Pull Request description should ideally mention what tests were run and whether code style checks were performed
- Keep one Pull Request focused on one class of change instead of merging unrelated requirements together
- Before opening a Pull Request, do a basic self-check on code style, naming, directory placement, and general usability

## Run Tests

Test directories:

- `tests/Unit`: unit tests
