> 🚀 **Kuaishou E-commerce PHP SDK** - A complete Kuaishou E-commerce API integration solution for PHP developers

## Overview

In an era of rapid technological growth, the KwaiShopSDK of the Kuaishou E-commerce Open Platform should have been a practical tool available to all developers. It covers Kuaishou E-commerce related open capabilities. From token acquisition to request packaging and response parsing, every step should help developers integrate efficiently.

Its localized design should have created a smoother path for developers of all experience levels, allowing them to move through API integration with far less friction. Yet the reality is surprising: in the highly active and mature PHP ecosystem, there is still no official PHP SDK.

That gap is hard to justify. PHP developers have contributed enormously to the internet, yet when developers in other languages can move faster with official SDK support, PHP teams are still left to push through the thorns by hand. It is the equivalent of running a marathon barefoot while everyone else has proper gear and full support.

Community-driven SDK work is what keeps PHP developers from falling behind, making it possible to build serious integration systems despite the extra effort required. A proper PHP SDK should not be an afterthought, and this project exists to provide the missing foundation.

Notes:

- Each official endpoint is mapped to its own dedicated class file
- `Api/*` folder names stay aligned with the official documentation categories whenever possible
- `Core/*` only contains foundational SDK concerns, not business endpoint logic
- New endpoints should be added to the matching category folder instead of generic catch-all files

## Installation

```bash
composer require westng/kwaishop-php-sdk
```

## Quick Start

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use KwaiShopSDK\Core\Profile\Config;
use KwaiShopSDK\Api\Shop\OpenScoreMasterGet;
use KwaiShopSDK\KwaiShopClient;

$config = new Config(
    appKey: 'your-app-key',
    appSecret: 'your-app-secret',
    signSecret: 'your-sign-secret',
);

$client = new KwaiShopClient($config);

$shop = (new OpenScoreMasterGet($client))->execute(
    accessToken: 'your-access-token',
);
```

Version `1.0.0` focuses on the SDK foundation first. Endpoint classes will be added incrementally by official documentation category.

If an endpoint class is not available yet, you can temporarily call:

```php
$response = $client->rawRequest(
    method: 'open.shop.info.get',
    params: [],
    accessToken: 'your-access-token',
    httpMethod: 'POST',
);
```

## Runtime Compatibility

This SDK is designed with both `FPM` and `Swoole Coroutine` runtimes in mind.

- Core SDK objects remain stateless and do not store request context in static variables or global singletons
- `KwaiShopClient`, `Config`, the request factory, and the response parser are safe to reuse across concurrent requests
- The default transport uses `Guzzle`
- The SDK auto-detects the current runtime; when it detects `Swoole Coroutine` and hooks are not enabled yet, the default transport will try to enable coroutine hooks automatically
- The SDK auto-detects `FPM / CLI / Swoole` and adjusts connection reuse strategy automatically:
- `FPM / CLI` keep connection reuse enabled by default
- `Swoole / Swoole Coroutine` disable cross-request connection reuse by default to avoid stale reused connections in long-lived workers
- If your project already has a coroutine-native HTTP client, you can inject a custom `TransportInterface` implementation directly

### Swoole Coroutine Example

```php
use KwaiShopSDK\Core\Profile\Config;
use KwaiShopSDK\KwaiShopClient;
use Swoole\Runtime;

Runtime::enableCoroutine(true);

$config = new Config(
    appKey: 'your-app-key',
    appSecret: 'your-app-secret',
    signSecret: 'your-sign-secret',
);

$client = new KwaiShopClient($config);
```

If you explicitly do not want the SDK to adapt the runtime automatically, you can disable it:

```php
$config = new Config(
    appKey: 'your-app-key',
    appSecret: 'your-app-secret',
    signSecret: 'your-sign-secret',
    autoDetectRuntime: false,
);
```

## Authentication

Typical platform credentials include:

- `app_key`
- `app_secret`
- `sign_secret`

If your integration also uses the platform message service or decryption workflows, the test environment template includes a message private key placeholder for local verification.

### Build an authorize URL

```php
$authorizeUrl = $client->oauth()->buildAuthorizeUrl(
    redirectUri: 'https://your-app.test/oauth/callback',
    scopes: ['merchant_order', 'merchant_item'],
    state: 'local-test',
);
```

### Exchange code for token

```php
$token = $client->oauth()->getAccessToken('authorization-code');

$accessToken = $token->accessToken();
$refreshToken = $token->refreshToken();
```

### Refresh token

```php
$token = $client->oauth()->refreshAccessToken('refresh-token');
```

### Get client credentials token

```php
$token = $client->oauth()->getClientCredentialsToken();
```

## Manual Debug

The repository includes a test-only environment template and manual helper scripts for local debugging.

### Test env template

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Notes:

- `.env.example` is only a template for test scenarios
- The SDK runtime does not read `.env`
- `tests/bootstrap.php` loads `.env` for PHPUnit and `tests/Functional/*` scripts

### OAuth helper

```bash
php tests/Functional/oauth_flow.php authorize --app-type=self https://your-callback.test/oauth/callback merchant_order,merchant_item local-test
php tests/Functional/oauth_flow.php authorize --app-type=self merchant_order,merchant_item local-test
php tests/Functional/oauth_flow.php authorize --app-type=service-market merchant_order,merchant_item local-test
php tests/Functional/oauth_flow.php exchange YOUR_CODE
php tests/Functional/oauth_flow.php refresh
php tests/Functional/oauth_flow.php client-token
```

Notes:

- If `KWAISHOP_TEST_REDIRECT_URI` is set in `.env`, `authorize` can omit the redirect URI argument
- `--app-type=self` is for self-developed apps
- `--app-type=service-market` is for service-market apps

### Raw API helper

```bash
php tests/Functional/api_call.php call open.shop.info.get '{}'
php tests/Functional/api_call.php call open.seller.order.list '{"pageSize":20,"pageNum":1}' YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

If the access token argument is omitted, the script falls back to `KWAISHOP_TEST_ACCESS_TOKEN` from `.env`.
